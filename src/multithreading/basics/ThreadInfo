- Whenever we execute a program the JVM creates a main thread. This is the last thread to complete execution

- When we create threads(using runnable or subclassing thread class) those are created from the main thread
- These are called worker threads

- JVM also creates daemon thread for garbage collection

- Daemon threads run in the background. they are usually low priority threads

- We can create daemon threads as well. Primarily worker threads are not interrupted by JVM but daemon threads are.
- That is a daemon thread is terminated by the JVM once worker threads have finished their execution.
