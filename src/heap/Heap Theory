1. Identification that a problem is based on heaps:
a) K
b) Largest/Smallest/Closest/Top/Bottom

2. K + smallest/Lowest/Closest = max heap problem

3. K + largest/Greatest/Top = min heap problem

4. Importance of K: 
Since, the questions are mostly based on sorting which would make complexity as nlogn.
Hence, To bring the complexity of a solution from (nlogn) to (nlogK)

5. Basic Implementation syntax
``` In Java, by default, it is a min-heap.
Min Heap:
PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();

Max Heap: Using comparator to make it a max heap.
PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a); ```
